# 156
- First contest after practicing around 90 problems
- solved the first with ~ 2 mins, stuck on the second for 2 hrs (trying to solve with DP)

## Lessons
- debugging was not efficient
    - can multiple times to test multiple test cases and compile once, saving lots of time compare to run single test case and compile
- wrap you head around
    - try different technique, don't stuck on the same one
    - try `two pointers`, `sliding window` etc
