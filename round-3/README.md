# Basic rules

1. Do problems by tags
2. Do problems by difficulty (from easy->medium->hard)
3. Do problems by acceptance (from high to low)
4. ~Participate in contest as many as possible~
    - I would say if you have time, then participate
    - As currently, it's not efficient ot participate since you can't even do all the problems...

# Plan
1. Do all easy problems of a particular tag first;
2. After finishing all easy problems of one tag, move to next tag's easy problems and start current tag's medium-hard problems
    - since more tags are done, I choose to do medium problems on tag basis.
    - eg: do 1 medium tag A on day 1, 1 medium tag B on day 2... in a loop
3. Repeat steps 1, 2

# Contest Plan
- Do weekly/bi-weekly contest on weekends, review non-AC problems on the next day and try to solve it; if cannot, see top ranked users' solution (and do it yourself again)

# Example

```
Day 1     --Finish Array-Easy--> Day 2
Array-Easy                       HashTable-Easy
...                              ...
Array-Easy                       HashTable-Easy
                                 Array-Medium
```
- Easy: do as many as you can per day
- Medium: do one to two per day
