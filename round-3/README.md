# Basic rules

1. Do problems by tags
2. Do problems by difficulty (from easy->medium->hard)
3. Do problems by acceptance (from high to low)

# Plan
1. Do all easy problems of a particular tag first;
2. After finishing all easy problems of one tag, move to next tag's easy problems and start current tag's medium-hard problems
3. Repeat steps 1, 2

# Example

```
Day 1     --Finish Array-Easy--> Day 2
Array-Easy                       HashTable-Easy
...                              ...
Array-Easy                       HashTable-Easy
                                 Array-Medium
```
- Easy: do as many as you can per day
- Medium: do one to two per day
